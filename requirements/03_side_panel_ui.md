# Side Panel Interface (Home & POM)

## 1. Home Tab
*   **Table**: Shows generated locators for the active element.
*   **Interactive Match Count**: Real-time count. Clicking highlights all matches in the DOM.
*   **Editable Locators**: Users can edit the produced locator; the match count should update automatically.

## 2. POM Tab
*   **Organization**: Group locators by "Pages".
*   **Flexible Scope**: A "Page" can span multiple URLs.
*   **Framework Persistence**: Pages remember the framework they were created with (e.g., a "Selenium Page").
*   **Cell Verification**: Individual cells in the POM table can be verified or healed if the element changes.

## 3. Global Settings
*   **Theme**: Light and Dark modes.
*   **Framework**: System-wide base setting (Selenium, Playwright, Cypress).
*   **Filters**: Toggle switch for specific locator strategies.
